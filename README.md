# Zillow Home Value Prediction

Welcome to the Zillow Home Value Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict home values using machine learning techniques. By leveraging various features of homes and surrounding data, the model predicts the future values of homes listed on Zillow.

## Overview

This project uses historical home sale prices and other relevant data to build a predictive model for estimating the current value of homes. The primary goal is to provide accurate and reliable home value predictions to assist homeowners, real estate agents, and buyers in making informed decisions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualization and statistical analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Using various machine learning algorithms to train models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Prediction**: Predicting home values based on trained models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes historical home sale prices and other related features. It can be obtained from [Zillow's public dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data) or any other relevant sources.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ML-Project-Zillow-Home-Value-Prediction/Zillow-Home-Value-Prediction.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
